An additional 1 to 3 inches of\nrainfall is expected across broad areas, with isolated higher\namounts of 4 to 8 inches possible within the watch area. This may\nlead to flash flooding, especially in vulnerable areas, and\nexacerbate already swollen rivers and streams around the area.\n\n* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be\npossible.\n\n* WHERE...A portion of southeast Texas, including the following\nareas, Austin, Brazos, Burleson, Chambers, Coastal Harris,\nColorado, Grimes, Houston, Inland Harris, Madison, Montgomery,\nNorthern Liberty, Polk, San Jacinto, Southern Liberty, Trinity,\nWalker, Waller and Washington.\n\n* WHEN...Through this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,\ncreeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.\nFlooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water\ncrossings may be flooded. Extensive street flooding and flooding\nof creeks and rivers are possible. Area creeks and streams are\nrunning high and could flood with more heavy rain.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- A new round of heavy rainfall is moving into the area from\nthe northwest very early this morning, and will continue to\nmake its way across Southeast Texas today. Because of\nmultiple rounds of heavy rain over the past week, flooding\nmay be seen earlier than would be expected under typical\nconditions. Rainfall today will continue to exacerbate\nexisting river flooding.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",

Run your air conditioner or an\nair purifier. If temperatures allow, avoid using whole house fans or\nswamp coolers that bring in outside air.\n\nExposure to high particle pollution levels can cause serious health\nproblems, including asthma attacks, heart and lung disease symptoms,\nand increased risk of respiratory infections. People with heart or\nlung diseases should follow their doctor's advice for dealing with\nepisodes of unhealthy air quality. Children, older adults, and\npeople with respiratory or heart disease should avoid prolonged\nexposure and strenuous activities when particle pollution levels are\nhigh.\n\nTo help minimize outdoor particle pollution levels:\n* Carpool, telecommute, reduce trips, or take public transportation\n* Slow down if driving on dirt roads\n* Stabilize loose soils\n\nLevels of particle pollution can vary hour by hour and by location\ndepending on wind conditions.\n\nTo view current and forecasted air quality levels, visit the South\nCoast Air Quality Management District website at aqmd.gov or\ndownload the mobile app at www.aqmd.gov/mobileapp. Additional\ndetails for this air quality alert may be available at\nwww.aqmd.gov/advisory.",
